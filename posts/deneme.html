    <p>The distinction between <em>models</em> and <em>inference procedures</em> is central to most
introductory presentations of artificial intelligence.  For example: HMMs are a
class of model; the Viterbi algorithm is one associated inference procedure,
the forward–backward algorithm is another, and particle filtering is a third.</p>

<p>Many people describe (and presumably think of) neural networks as a class of
models. I want to argue that this view is misleading, and that it is more useful
to think of neural networks as hopelessly entangled model–inference pairs.
“Model–inference pair” is a mouthful, and there doesn’t seem to be good
existing shorthand, so I will henceforth refer to such objects as “monferences”.
My claim is that we should think of a neural network as an example of a
monference. (An implementation of the Viterbi algorithm, equipped with the
parameters of some <em>fixed</em> HMM, is also a monference.)</p>

<p>I’m about to cite a bunch of existing papers that follow naturally from the
neural-nets-as-monferences perspective—it seems like this idea is already
obvious to a lot of people. But I don’t think it’s been given a name or a
systematic treatment, and I hope others will find what follows as useful
(or at least as deconfounding) as I did.</p>

<hr />

<p>What are the consequences of regarding a neural net as a <em>model</em>?
A personal example is illustrative:</p>

<p>The first time I saw a recurrent neural network, I thought “this is an
interesting model with a broken inference procedure”. A recurrent net looks like
an HMM. An HMM has a discrete hidden state, and a recurrent net has a
vector-valued hidden state.  When we do inference in an HMM, we maintain a
distribution over hidden states consistent with the output, but when we do
inference in a recurrent net, we maintain only a single vector—a single
hypothesis, and a greedy inference procedure. Surely things would be better if
there were some way of modeling uncertainty? Why not treat RNN inference like
Kalman filtering?</p>

<p>This complaint is <em>wrong</em>. Our goal in the remainder of this post is to explore
why it’s wrong.</p>
